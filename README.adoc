= JEE WebJars Locator

Provides a way to locate https://www.webjars.org[WebJars] resources in a https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/[Jakarta REST/JAX-RS] environment without the need to repeat the version of the WebJar in the path.

It also provides static files (and with the correct `Content-Type` derived from the file extension) when the application is in the root path, e.g. when the `.war` file is called `ROOT.war` in WildFly.
